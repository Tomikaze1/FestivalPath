🎪 FestivalPath: Your Pedestrian Lifeline at Festivals
FestivalPath is a revolutionary navigation app designed for vehicle-free events, solving the chaos of crowded festivals where traditional maps fail. No more circling blocked streets or missing performances—just smart, crowd-verified walking routes to your destination.

🎯 Purpose
Festivals are nightmares for pedestrians:

Google Maps directs you through car roads that are closed

Tourists waste 30+ minutes in avoidable crowds

Locals know secret shortcuts—but visitors never benefit

FestivalPath fixes this by:
✔ Providing festival-specific walking paths (not car routes)
✔ Crowdsourcing real-time shortcuts from experienced attendees
✔ Using landmarks ("Turn left at the taco stand") for no-signal areas

🌟 Vision
"To transform chaotic festival experiences into seamless adventures through collective navigation intelligence."

🎯 Mission
Tourists: Deliver reliable pedestrian routes tailored to event layouts

Event Organizers: Reduce crowd bottlenecks with smart traffic flow

Locals: Monetize their insider knowledge by contributing shortcuts

🛠️ Features
📱 Tourist Side
🗺️ Offline Festival Maps: Pre-download event layouts with official walking paths

🚶 Crowdsourced Shortcuts: *"Use this alley behind Stage 2 to skip the 20-min gate line!"*

📍 Landmark Navigation: "Walk toward the giant Ferris wheel, then right at the sponsor tent"

🔥 Heatmap Alerts: Avoid overcrowded zones in real-time

🎪 Organizer Side
📊 Crowd Analytics: See pinch points to improve future layouts

📢 Emergency Alerts: Broadcast route changes (e.g., "Main gate closed—use Gate B")

🔒 Firebase Rules: User-generated content expires after events

Example Rule:

match /shortcuts/{shortcutId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
    request.resource.data.eventId == "coachella-2024";
}
